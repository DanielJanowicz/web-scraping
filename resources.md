# Resources:

Here are the resources I used in order to assist with the development of this repo.

I used the [FacePunch Commits](https://commits.facepunch.com/) website for my first web scrapping file.  FacePunch is a game studio, and the website posts their own commits (similar to github).  

I also used the [CyberPowerPC](https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/category/esports-gaming-pcs/) website to gather information on some PCs.  This includes the title of the PC build, the specs, price, and shipping status.
