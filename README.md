# Using python code to web scrape two websites and display collected information in a dataframe

## facepunch.py
This python file will scrape through the FacePunch commits website for the title (broken down into three parts), a description, and the time of the commit.  The cleaned dataframe has been saved to the **data folder** 

## cyberpower.py
This python file will scrape through the CyberPowerPC website and gather information on the computers listed on their site.  **Known issue:** Under specs, everything was combined into one table since the html did not divide it through.  The information was saved to the **data folder**

## resources.md
This is just another markdown file that houses the resources used in this repo. This is primarily meant to refer back to in the future, or others can utilize it for their own repo.
